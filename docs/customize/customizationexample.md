* Guide with project specific help
* Easy filtering with fewer clicks
* Show an image from a related entry (film).
* Add new screenings without loading new pages. Especially useful when there is a lot of repetition. Just change
  date/time, click 'Create', done.
* Add actions: delete and a custom 'Approve' action.
